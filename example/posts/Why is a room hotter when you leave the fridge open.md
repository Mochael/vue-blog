title: Why is a room hotter when you leave the fridge open

- Fridge has a fluid running inside it to cool it. Fluid is kept at state between vapor and fluid so that it will be at a constant temperature (energy added or subtracted will cause it to change state not temperature). Heat from fridge is pulled into fluid and then eventually gets pushed outside the fridge heating outside the fridge while cooling inside it
- If fridge is open then the fluid treats the entire room as the fridge and has to cool. This requires more work from the internal components of the fridge like the compressor because more heat must be absorbed. More work means that more heat will be created so in addition to the heat pulled from the room/fridge you are cooling, the fridge will release the heat generated from the extra work, causing the room to be hotter
