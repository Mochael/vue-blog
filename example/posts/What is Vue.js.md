Apparently syntax is very similar to Svelte (see [[What is Svelte]]) (so also like normal javascript) and you can insert javascript variables into HTML by using curly braces `{variable_name}` anywhere in the HTML markup.

However, Vue.js doesn't come with a compiler (so no performance optimizations), so everything is done client-side. The processing that happens on the development machine is limited to optional single-file `.vue` components.

**Nuxt.js** is a framework built on top of Vue.js to make it easier to develop in Vue.js
