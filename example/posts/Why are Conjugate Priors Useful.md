title: Why are Conjugate Priors Useful
tree_state: ðŸŒ±
---

Suppose our prior follows a beta distribution $$p(\theta) \sim Beta(\alpha,\beta)$$ and we have a binomial likelihood $$p(x\mid\theta)$$.
$$
p(\theta \mid x) = p(x \mid \theta) p(\theta)
$$
Since the beta is a conjugate prior for the binomial likelihood, we can show that $$p(\theta \mid x) \sim Beta(k+\alpha,n-k+\beta)$$.

- We don't need to actually calculate this $$p(\theta \mid x)$$ with the computer since it just follows a known distribution and the MAP estimate for this distribution will be of the same form as the optimal estimate of $$p(\theta)$$, just with the adjusted $$k+\alpha, \ n-k+\beta$$ values.
