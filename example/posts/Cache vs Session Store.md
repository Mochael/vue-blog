Cache is stored at an application level, not a user level. So, content in the cache is shared between users.

In session storage, the app stores all session-related data from a specific user like their profile information, messages, personalized data and themes, recommendations, targeted promotions and discounts, etc. So, content in session storage must be separated user to user.
