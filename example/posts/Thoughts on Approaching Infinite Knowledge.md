title: Thoughts on Approaching Infinite Knowledge

As we approach infinite knowledge, would we approach some true/real morality?

If knowledge converges to infinity then do we all have each others knowledge, so everyone would share the same moral standards, and thus those standards would be right in the sense that no one would disagree with them. They would be right only because we would make them right.
