**HTTPS** (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is an encrypted version of the [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP) protocol. It used to use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption, but now uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt all communication between a client and a server.
