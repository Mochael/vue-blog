**Hypervisor**: also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing.

There are two main hypervisor types, referred to as “Type 1” (or “bare metal”) and “Type 2” (or “hosted”). A **type 1 hypervisor** acts like a lightweight operating system and runs directly on the host’s hardware, while a **type 2 hypervisor** runs as a software layer on an operating system, like other computer programs.
