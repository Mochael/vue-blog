title: How does a QR Code Work
tree_state: ðŸŒ±

Barcodes encode information in 1 dimensional, but QR codes are an improvement that encode it in 2 dimensions.

QR codes encode text which can be used to either just get the stored text or send you to URLs that contain more info like a pdf, photos, etc.

Different sections of a QR code encode things like: what decoding system to use, the raw data that stores the text, position detecting markers etc.
