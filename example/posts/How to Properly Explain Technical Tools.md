title: How to Properly Explain Technical Tools
tree_state: ðŸŒ±

When I encounter the name of a new software engineering tool and I try to read learn about it, most sources do an awful job of explaining how they work. I search through the article and even with the 1000+ words I come away with no better understanding than I did before. This is especially the case for the actual product websites themselves, they do a terrible job of explaining their own products. Most sources when explaining a topic use extremely vague language, that don't make it clear what the tool does at all.

## Here are Steps to Explain a Tool Better

1. First explain the setting of the problem that the tool is trying to solve.
2. Explain existing tools that try to solve the problem (if any exist)
3. Then explain how your product addresses the problem and is better than the existing tools
